## Tweaks that would improve the site long-term ("TODOs"):

-   Accessibility improvements (aria-attributes, etc.)
-   Localization (incl. rtl/ltr optimizations)
-   Basic CMS login / editing of content via portal -- storage of content on server or firebase integration
-   More responsive design (rem instead of pixels, flexible grid layouts, etc)
-   Automated github build/deployment
-   Testing on more browsers / devices.
